## Accessing Data from opendata.swiss
***

The opendata.swiss portal is a joint project of the Confederation, cantons, communes and other organizations with a mandate from the state. It makes open government data available to the general public in a central catalogue. opendata.swiss is operated by the Federal Statistical Office.

Since I would like to publish data for the Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden on opendata.swiss in the future, I wanted to work with existing data from the portal first.

For this purpose, I selected a data set from the Federal Statistical Office. It is about [offences registered by the police](https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/polizeilich-registrierte-straftaten-gemass-strafgesetzbuch-nach-kanton-ausfuhrungsgrad-und-aufk5) according to the penal code by canton, degree of execution and degree of clarification. The dataset covers the period 1 January 2009 - 31 December 2022.

The first thing I studied was the JSON structure. I wondered why there was no actual data in the JSON file. Later I realised that the JSON structure actually only describes the structure of the HTML, but does not contain the data.

I had to download the data from an [interactive table](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/de/px-x-1903020100_101/px-x-1903020100_101/px-x-1903020100_101.px/). I did this first in JSON format, later also for the CSV version.

```{r dataset, include = FALSE, echo=FALSE }
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)

# load data
df <- fread(here::here("data", "px-x-1903020100_101_20230427-102332.csv"), header = TRUE)

# make data tidy
df_strft <- df %>% 
  mutate(`2021` = as.character(`2021`)) %>%
  mutate(`2022` = as.character(`2022`)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`2009`, `2010`, `2011`, `2012`, `2013`, `2014`,`2015`, 
                        `2016`,`2017`, `2018`, `2019`, `2020`, `2021`, `2022`),
               names_to = "Jahr",
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Value = as.numeric(Value)) %>% # change to numeric
  mutate(Jahr = as.numeric(Jahr)) # change to numeric
```

## Development Number of Offences
***

First I took a closer look at a few cantons in eastern Switzerland. I am interested in how the number of unsolved and solved cases has developed over the years. Has this developed similarly in the different cantons?
Here are the number of offences registered by the police according to canton and degree of clarification:
